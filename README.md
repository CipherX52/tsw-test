# TS Works Assignment

Built with Express and NodeJS

## Running locally

on a terminal, run:

`git clone https://github.com/CipherX52/tsw-test.git && cd tsw-test` and

`npm install && npm start`

the backend server should be listening on port 3000

Now on your browser, go to [http://localhost:3000/api/yyyy-mm-dd](http://localhost:3000/api/2021-05-06)

Change the date (in `yyyy-mm-dd` format) to retrieve stock values for the required date (as long as values are available for the given date).

Used the downloaded [csv](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history?p=AAPL) as the backend data source.
